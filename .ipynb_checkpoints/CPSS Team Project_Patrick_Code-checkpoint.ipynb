    "\n",
    "* [data.world](https://data.world/)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Public APIs](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Awesome-APIs List](https://github.com/Kikobeats/awesome-api)\n",

We recommend keeping track of these exploration and cleanup steps in a dedicated Jupyter Notebook, both for organization's sake and to make it easier to  present your work later.\n",

    "We recommend focusing your analysis on techniques such as aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis.\n",
