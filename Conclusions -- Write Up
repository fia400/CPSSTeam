Conclusion:

According to our data, there is no strong correlation to opioid related deaths and medical and recreational marijuana
becoming legal. Variables, such as new prescription drug legislature, government regulations, and drug prevention 
programs i.e. (PDMP) have contributed to decreases in prescription drugs entering the market. Even with the decrease
in legally prescribed drugs we continue to see an increasing trend in opioid related deaths. We accept the null
hypothesis that there is no correlation of opioid related deaths in relation to legalizing medical and recreational marijuana.
At the beginning of the project, our scope was limited. We wanted to see if there was a correlation between opioid abuse 
and marijuana legalization. It was easy to find the correlation (or lack thereof) and we finished that initial part of 
the project pretty quickly. Since we finished earlier than we thought, we decided to go a little further. Next, we sought
data on pharmaceutical prescriptions to track the use of prescribed opioids over the years. We wanted to see if there was
a correlation between that data and the states that had legalized. There seemed to be. As we researched further we found 
that, around the time states began legalizing, states also started cracking down on opioid abuse. Legislation was put in 
place to ensure abuse of pharmaceuticals was limited. This resulted in a decline in prescriptions but not a decline a in 
the death rate. Overall, there seems to be little to no correlation between legalization and opioid related deaths.
